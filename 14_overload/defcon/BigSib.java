Thanks to the dojo for showing me what a constructor was
**/

/**
DISCO
-I discovered what a constructor actually was (I had only been making instance variables)
-I discovered how an overloaded constructor works (a constructor that takes args)
-I discovered contructors are methods
QCC
-I don't get how to use both a constructor and overloaded constructor together
-The instance variable should be private
-I don't think I did this hw right. My team also didn't know.
-How do we give each Instance their own personal msg without an input? Is it possible without 
conditionals?
-Is there a way to get the name of the new Instance made?

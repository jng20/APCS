First start implementing celebrity class. Create instance variables and constructor. Move on to accessor and mutators

Q: ToString method: should it return more than just celebrity name

Decided to skip the GUI stuff (during class) in Game class first so that logic will function currently. 
But if AP instructions told us to do GUI we did


QCC
- How to use swingset?
- How to play the game in the terminal?
- Difference between preparegame() and celebrityGame() constructor?
- when will we have to call setclue/setanswer in celebrity if it's all done in the overloaded constructor?

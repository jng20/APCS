QCC
why does college board make terrible labs?
Piazza is really helpful.

<TNPG>'s CSV FLOW:
<insert your description of your tools and workflow in creating, editing CSV files>
A lot of the code was given to us. We just had to copy paste it with a different key.


TRUBZ
<this lab involves using tools that are likely to introduce hiccups; log any troubleshooting issues here>
We had trouble with the sinbad.jar stuff but piazza was really helpful.

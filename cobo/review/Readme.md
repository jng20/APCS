# L06: Read/Review/Expand

## Team Blue Pandas (Jacob Ng, Andrew Piatetsky, Emily Ortiz)

## Summary

This lab was not very difficult. However, it took a time to understand what to do, plan it and then do it accordingly.

Some specific notes:
 - The algorithms that were assigned took much longer than the open ended questions, but through team work we managed to get through them.
 - Some questions were very confusing because they were not CS related and we thought we had to somehow relate them to cs. (Like the "why would you want to leave a bad review question")
 - Our final project was to create a username/gamertag generator. We used the functions that we had already written to replace spaces with underscores in an inputted String.
 - Our group decided to divide the work since a lot of it was pretty straighforward and just time consuming.


### Activity 5 file is called CreateUsername.java

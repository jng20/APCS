DISCO
Absolutely nothing. Everything we hypothesized in our group was wrong. Only thing still standing is that 
we have 2 sections: 1 section full of the numbers less than what was at index c or in our code, int middle
		     1 section full of the numbers greater than what was at index c or in our code, int middle
QCC
Suspect Pivot Sort? Maybe int middle really shouldn't be the middle but the pivot? Don't know if 
int begin and begin end are correct.
Jacob - don't know what pivot sort is but heard of it and this pseudocode seems like there's a pivot.

q0: What does it do?
the list is split into 2 sections: one for values greater than arr[c] and one for values less than arr[c]

q1: What is its Big-Oh runtime?
O(n) because we have one for loop and it traverses the list once.

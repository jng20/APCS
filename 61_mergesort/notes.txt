Reflect on your in-class experience.
Jot down as many observables as you can.
Converse with mates to fill in anything you may have missed.
Discuss how to clean up the process.


DISCO
*This is merge sort.
*Mr.Mykolyk can shuffle and bridge very well

QCC
*We were given the task of taking two sorted lists and combining them into 1 sorted list.
Originally, what we did was compared the first elements in each list and which ever was smaller
we added to the big list. Then, we remove the item from the small list and repeat the whole process.
However, we then went on to try to sort a deck of cards split into to halves and we didn't use this process.
Instead, we kept splitting those halves into more halves until the half was sorted(you had one card). Then, were
supposed to give our half back to whoever gave it to us and then they would sort the halves they received and then repeat
until supposedly the deck comes back together sorted. This did not happen because we often failed to properly give back to the right person.

*Why is it faster to merge 2 sorted lists into 1 sorted list vs 2 unsorted lists into 1 sorted list?
*Won't we run into a problem since we don't have 52 people in the class? Won't some people have to receive and give cards more than twice.

*I think it would help if people lined up on the wall in some order so that it's easier to know who to give the cards back to.
Or we can give people numbers or some sort of ID to help people remember who to give cards back to.

THINKER FIRMWARE (Instructions each turtle follows)
*If you have more than one card in your hand, evenly distribute the cards you have to 2 different thinkers who don't have cards. Leave hands out.
*If you have 1 card in your hand, return it back to whomever gave it to you.
*If cards are returned to you, sort cards and return to whomever gave it to you.

Error types
Compile-time errors indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program. Example: omitting the semicolon at the end of a statement.

Run-time errors are produced if something goes wrong while the program is running. Example: an infinite recursion eventually causes a StackOverflowError.

Logic errors cause the program to do the wrong thing. Example: an expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect.

Compile Time Errors
-incremental development so it's easier to know where the error is
-If a bunch of errors are spewed focus on the first one because it may be that the first one is the only real errors
-compiler will tell you what line it finds the error
-fix indenting and check for syntax errors like missing symbols or not returning the right type. Also, static non static problems
-Make sure the version you are editing is the one you are compiling
-debugging by bisection. Cut code in half and compile each half to see which half has error. Keep repeating
-Don't trust the compiler solution but it can easily be wrong

Run Time errors
-print statements will be helpful
-hanging - infinite loop or recursion
-entering the loop exiting the loop
-infinite recursion stack overflow
For infinite loops
-add a print statement at the end of the loop that displays the values of the variables in the condition, and the value of the condition.
-you can see if the variables are reaching the condition or not
For infinite recursions
-check for base case
-add print statement for the parameters and check if the parameters are getting towards the base case
-add "entering methodname" so you can see how your recursion is flowing
-displays a trace of each method as it's invoked
-common error is providing arguments in the wrong order
Exceptions
-nullpointer exception - invoking a variable or object that is null
-ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - negative index or index not in range of array
-StackOverflowError:
-FileNotFoundException - java didn't find the file
-ArithmeticException - like dividing by 0

Logic Errors
-Compiler can't help but the code isn't outputting what you want
-Is something supposed to happen but not happening?
-Is something happening that's not supposed to happen?
-is a section of code producing an unexpected effect?
-Break program into methods and test each method individually
-Use more variables to make things clearer. Temporary variables
-Try println instead of print because sometimes print just stores the output until the next new line

If Stuck
-walk away from the machine
-computar causes frustration and rage, superstitious beliefs, and sour grapes
-Let your mind wander and you may find the bug then

If really Stuck
-Get another pair of eyes and inform them of everything you did, all the error msgs, what you've tried, and what you've learned
-Rubber Duck Debugging
-Talk to your rubber duck
-Explain problems
-Find solution
-Thank Ducky

After finding bug
-Debrief. What was the bug, how did I find it, how can I prevent it or find it faster in the future.

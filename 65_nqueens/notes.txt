QCC:
Is it cheating using a for loop in our recursive solve solution.


DISCO:

The recursion works by backtracking without actively backtracking.
Uses a previous version of the for loop to just move on to the next available position.

Drawing diagrams makes it much easier.

Going right 1, down 2 at first because that is the first available available position.




How it works?

Places a queen at the first position (0,0), then tries to place a queen in the next column over (0,1), if that's possible than move to the next.
Repeat until impossible (or solve on first try?), and then backtrack to the previous column and try a solution starting on the next row.
Repeat until find a solution or don't.

QCC:
Does the first insert create the root or should the root be a fixed value?
What to do if the value already exists in tree?
Let the computer do the work. Just like knights tour.

In our height method we have to do minus 1 at the end because we initialize our tree with 0.

L = level   d = depth   h = height

From Gabriel Thompson
1. a perfect binary tree has 2^L - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is Ceiling( log_2(n + 1) ) - 1

/*
Disco
There are 3 cases 0 child 1 child 2 child
If the node you want to have removed has 2 children and neither child is a leaf, you can just take the right child and attach it to the right most leaf of the left child.
(not sure if this is cheating or not)
When removing the root of the entire tree, you gotta reset the root.

QCC:
Does the first insert create the root or should the root be a fixed value?
What to do if the value already exists in tree?
Let the computer do the work. Just like knights tour.

In our height method we have to do minus 1 at the end because we initialize our tree with 0.


Algo for remove
-if target has 0 child
  - chop off ties to child
-if target has 1 child
  - have the parent of the target link up with its grandchild instead of its child(target)
-if target has 2 children
  - If the node you want to have removed has 2 children and neither child is a leaf, you can just take the right child and attach it to the right most leaf of the left child.
  - if one child is a leaf then have the leaf link to the other child

Didn't feel like recursion. Did we do something wrong?

L = level   d = depth   h = height

From Gabriel Thompson
1. a perfect binary tree has 2^L - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is Ceiling( log_2(n + 1) ) - 1

QCC:
Does the first insert create the root or should the root be a fixed value?
What to do if the value already exists in tree?
Let the computer do the work. Just like knights tour

L = level   d = depth   h = height

1. a perfect binary tree has (2^d) + 1 nodes?
2. At each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^L nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is log(n+1) - 1? Same as perfect tree?
